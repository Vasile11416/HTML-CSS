      My experience at Kaaterskill Falls was spectacular. It was early november
      when we set out on the 2.5 hour drive. We reached the falls just before
      the afternoon buzz and quickly decended down the trail. Steps, so many
      steps. We veered off the main trail down a slippery path and reached the
      first falls. As I walked closer to the falls, I began to feel the mist on
      my cheeks, chilly, but I just kept walking. As I got closer, I paused, I
      got down on one knee and snapped this pic. I realized after but I was so
      excited to be there that I forgot my smile, close enough though :)
